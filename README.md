# Seminar Report Template @ UPB-CN

This is the official template for writing seminar reports at both the bachelor and master levels at the Computer Networks group at UPB. 

Please make sure you follow the guidelines and the instructions in the template closely. The high-level structure should not be changed, unless there is a good reason and you have already communicated it with your supervisor(s).
